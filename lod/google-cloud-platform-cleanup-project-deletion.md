## Overview

The GCP Cleanup feature allows you, as a lab user, to automatically delete your GCP project and clean up all associated resources upon completing a GCP challenge lab. This ensures that all resources are properly removed and your user account is no longer associated with the GCP project.

## Project Deletion Process

When you complete a GCP challenge lab, the project associated with the lab will be deleted along with all the GCP resources tied to it. This process will be triggered automatically, and you don't need to perform any manual steps.

## Cleaning Up GCP Resources

During the project deletion process, all GCP resources associated with the project will be cleaned up. This includes removing instances, disks, networks, and any other resources provisioned within the project. Please note that this action is irreversible, and all data stored within the project will be permanently deleted.

## User Account Disassociation

Once the project deletion is complete, your user account will no longer be associated with the GCP project. This means you will no longer have access to the project or any resources within it. If you need to access GCP services in the future, you will need to create a new project or join an existing one.

## Usage

The GCP Cleanup: Project Deletion feature will be automatically applied when you complete a GCP challenge lab. There is no need to enable or configure this feature manually.

Please ensure that you have completed all necessary tasks and have backed up any important data from the project before starting a GCP challenge lab. Once the lab is marked as completed, the project deletion process will begin, and all associated resources will be permanently deleted.

## Conclusion

The GCP Cleanup: Project Deletion feature ensures that your GCP resources are properly cleaned up and your user account is disassociated from the GCP project when you complete a GCP challenge lab. This eliminates the need for manual cleanup and helps maintain a clean and organized GCP environment.
