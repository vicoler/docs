1.  Monitor the update process and ensure that each Azure service is successfully updated to the desired version.

1.  After completing the update process for all Azure services, verify the functionality of the system to ensure that it is working as expected.

## Considering Dependencies

During the update process, it is important to consider any dependencies associated with different versions of Azure services. Dependencies may exist between Azure services or between Azure services and other components of our system. To ensure a smooth update, follow these guidelines:

1.  Identify the dependencies between different versions of Azure services.

## Testing Procedures

To validate the update and ensure the proper functionality of our system, it is essential to conduct comprehensive testing. Follow these testing procedures:

1.  Perform regression testing on Azure user management, including CRUD operations and permissions.

1.  Test lab launches and verify that the updated Azure services are functioning correctly.

1.  Assign roles and policies as required and confirm that they are applied correctly in the updated versions.

1.  Tear down labs and ensure that all associated users and resources are properly deleted.

1.  Purge users by checking for any users in Azure that are in a deleted state and can be safely removed.

1.  By conducting thorough testing, we can ensure that the updated Azure reference versions are fully functional and aligned with our system's requirements.
