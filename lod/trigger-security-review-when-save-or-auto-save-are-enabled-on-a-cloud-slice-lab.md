This review is conducted to evaluate the cloud resource costs and determine the necessity of the save features for your lab. This ensures that labs are optimized for cost-efficiency and resource utilization.

## Enabling Save or Auto-save Feature

When creating or editing a cloud slice lab profile, you will find options to enable the save and auto-save features. By enabling either of these features, you indicate your preference to have the lab content saved automatically or manually by users.

## Security Review Trigger

Once you enable the save or auto-save feature, a security review will be automatically triggered. The purpose of this review is to assess the following aspects:

1.  Cloud Resource Costs: The review will evaluate the potential impact on cloud resource costs, considering factors such as storage, compute, and data transfer. It ensures that the save and auto-save features do not incur unnecessary expenses.

1.  Necessity for Save Features: The review will determine the necessity of the save features for your lab. It ensures that the save and auto-save functionalities align with the intended learning objectives and user requirements.

## Benefits

By triggering a security review for save and auto-save features, the following benefits are achieved:

1.  Cost Optimization: The review helps identify any potential cost implications associated with saving lab content. It ensures that unnecessary cloud resource consumption is minimized, promoting cost optimization.

1.  Resource Utilization: The review ensures that the save and auto-save features are justified in terms of their contribution to the learning experience. It helps maintain efficient resource utilization within the lab environment.

## Regression Testing on Temporary Approvals

If temporary approvals have been granted for specific labs, it is essential to perform regression testing. This ensures that the temporary approvals are still functioning correctly and do not interfere with the security review process triggered by enabling save or auto-save features.

## Conclusion

With the Trigger Security Review for Save and Auto-save Features in Cloud Slice Labs feature, lab authors can ensure that the use of save and auto-save functionalities is reviewed for cost efficiency and necessity. Enable the save or auto-save feature in your cloud slice lab profile to initiate the security review process.
