# Google Cloud Platform: Delete Lab User Accounts Instead of Disabling Them

## Overview

Lab user accounts that are no longer needed will be automatically deleted during the cleanup process, eliminating the need for manual removal of disabled accounts. By automating the deletion of unnecessary user accounts, administrators can save time and effort in account maintenance tasks.
Removing unused accounts helps optimize system resources, leading to better overall performance. Also,Deleting user accounts reduces the risk of potential security breaches associated with inactive or unused accounts.

## Introduction

To improve the efficiency of lab cleanup in GCP, we have enhanced the process to delete user accounts instead of disabling or suspending them. This enhancement streamlines account management and eliminates the need for manual removal of disabled accounts in the future. Additionally, the cleanup process ensures that associated projects in GCP challenge labs are deleted upon completion.

## Understanding the Enhancement

Lab cleanup will now remove or delete user accounts instead of disabling or suspending them. This means that when a lab is completed or no longer needed, the user accounts associated with that lab will be automatically removed. This process simplifies account management and ensures that unnecessary user accounts are promptly deleted, reducing clutter and potential security risks in your environment. By deleting user accounts instead of disabling them, you no longer need to manually remove disabled accounts in the future.

## Testing and Verification

To verify the effectiveness of this enhancement, the following testing process should be followed:

1.  Run GCP challenge labs as usual.
1.  Upon completion of a challenge lab, ensure that the associated user accounts are deleted automatically.
1.  Verify that the deletion of user accounts includes the removal of associated projects in GCP.
1.  Test multiple challenge labs to ensure consistency in the deletion process.
1.  Check for any errors or issues during the cleanup process and report them to your lab administrator or support team.
1.  By following this testing process, you can ensure that the lab cleanup now properly deletes user accounts and associated projects in GCP challenge labs.

If you encounter any issues, have questions, or need assistance, please reach out to your lab administrator or support team.

Note: It is essential to keep in mind that this enhancement specifically applies to lab cleanup in GCP and deleting user accounts. Regular user account management and associated processes outside of lab cleanup may still follow your organization's standard procedures.
