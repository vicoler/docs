# I just ordered online labs through the Skillable Marketplace for Microsoft Partners. How do I get started? 

You should already have an organization and user account setup in Skillable Training Management System (TMS). Note - your login information for TMS is different from your login info for the Skillable Marketplace for Microsoft Partners.  Your vouchers will automatically sync over from Skillable Marketplace for Microsoft Partners and be available in the Skillable  TMS. It may take up to 10 minutes for the sync to occur after purchase. 

## Next Steps

To get your class(es) setup, you will need to:  

1. [Sign into the TMS](https://alh.learnondemand.net).  

1. [Create class(es)](https://docs.learnondemandsystems.com/tms/arvato-marketplace/fulfilling-marketplace-order/set-up-class.md) with lab vouchers. A voucher is equivalent to your online lab purchase. For example, if you purchased 20 online labs through Skillable Marketplace for Microsoft Partners, you will see 20 vouchers in the Skillable TMS available which you can redeem to schedule 20 students in a class.

1. [Create training keys](https://docs.skillable.com/tms/arvato-marketplace/fulfilling-marketplace-order/enroll-students-in-class.md) for your students to self-register in the class. After setting up training keys, send the training keys and [self-registration instructions](https://docs.skillable.com/tms/tms-administrators/classes/training-keys/information-to-send-to-students-who-are-registering-using-training-keys.md) to your students.
