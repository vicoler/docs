# How do I set up a class?

To give your students access to the labs you purchase in the Skillable Marketplace for Microsoft Partners, you need to set up a class in our TMS. Your vouchers are automatically sync'd from the Skillable Marketplace for Microsoft Partners and loaded into the TMS. It may take up to 10 minutes for the sync to occur. Once the vouchers are available in the TMS, you can use them to set up a class.

Skillable lab access is controlled by class start time. This allows you to set up the class with labs immediately after purchase, well in advance of the class starting. Students will not be able to access the labs until they are enrolled in the class and the class has started. Instructors can access the labs as soon as they are added as instructors to the class. You do not need to purchase labs for the instructors.

To set up a class after a purchase, open the Manage Class Vouchers page:
1. On the **Admin** menu in the **Class Vouchers** group, click **Manage Class Vouchers**.

> The Manage Class Vouchers page has the Available Vouchers and Create Class sections. Voucher use is tallied under the Available Vouchers section. If a warning icon appears beside the number of available vouchers, hovering your mouse will show the number of those vouchers that will expire within 30 days.

On the Manage Class Vouchers page:

1. Enter the number of students who will be enrolled in the class in the **Students** field. Since you may create multiple classes using the vouchers, this can be less than or equal to the number of vouchers that are available for the course.
