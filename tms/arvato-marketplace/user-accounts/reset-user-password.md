# How do I, as an Administrative user, reset a user's password?

For enhanced security, administrators do not have the ability to reset passwords for users authenticated through our site. This measure ensures that only the rightful account owners have control over their passwords and reduces the potential for unauthorized access.

When a user needs a password reset an email can either be initiated by an administrator or by the user.
