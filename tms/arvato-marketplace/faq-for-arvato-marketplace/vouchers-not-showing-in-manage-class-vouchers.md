# Why are my class vouchers not showing in Manage Class Vouchers?

Voucher purchases from the Skillable Marketplace for Microsoft Partners sync over automatically after purchase. This process can take up to 10 minutes from purchase. 

If after waiting 10 or more minutes and the vouchers have not synchronized, please submit a Support ticket at [**https://skill.info/support**](https://skill.info/support). Please provide the email of the user that purchased the vouchers, the organization name, and the order ID.
