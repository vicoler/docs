# How do I issue badges to my students?

> Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this and linked articles may be available to you.

Badges can be issued automatically or manually, and you also have the option to have both methods concurrently in place. Badges can be awarded for completing any of the following: a lab, a course or a set of courses through course assignments or classes, or completing a learning path with an exam. Points may also be accumulated by accomplishing those tasks with a badge awarded when a set number of points are earned.

### Automatically Issue Badges
Automatic badge issuance is efficient and time saving since the badges are automated to be awarded on completion of a task or set of tasks. At this time, any user who has at any time completed the requirements to earn a badge will be issued the badge. Badges are issued within an hour of the task's completion. 

To automate issuing badges, an achievement must be set up to find the completion of a task. Achievements are mapped to a badge and the badge is automatically issued once the achievement is completed.

### Manually Issue Badges
Manual badge issuance grants you and your instructors the control to award a badge to a student rather than only having badges issued automatically when meeting the requirements to earn it. In these cases, you can set the badge to be manually issued and then you can issue the badge from the class' Roster or from individual course assignments.

As an administrator, with the proper permissions, you and your instructors can now manually issue badges to students. This allows you 

To set a badge to allow manual issuance:
1. Navigate to the badge's **Profile** page.
1. Click **Edit** to edit the badge.
1. At the bottom of the **Basic Information** tab, check **Enable Manual Issuance**.
1. Click **Save**.

## Class Roster
Either you or an instructor can issue badge(s) to students in a class and will do it via the Roster page. You can issue for one student or for a batch of students.

### Individual User Issuance
Use this method if you only need to issue one badge to one student. To issue the badge:

1. On the class' **Roster** page to the right of the student, click the **Issue a Badge** icon. This will open the Choose Badge dialog and display only those badges that are set to be manually issued.
1. In the **Choose Badge** dialog, search for and select the badge you want to issue and click **(Select a Badge)**. The button will briefly change to **Successfully Issued Badge** before closing the dialog.

### Batch Issuance

Use this method if you want to issue multiple badges to one student or one or more badges to multiple students. To do a batch issuance:

1. On the class' **Roster** page, click **Issue Badges** in the quick launch bar.
1. On the **Issue Badges** page under **Badges**, click **Add Badges**. 
1. In the **Choose Badges** dialog, select the badges to be issued and click **(Select a Badge)**. Only badges belonging to the same organization as the class and have been marked to allow manual issuance will be listed.
1.  Under **Students**, click **Add Students**. 
1. In the **Choose Student(s)** dialog, select the student(s) to whom to issue the badge and click **OK**. If the instructor is an organization instructor (not a contract instructor), only enrolled students from the instructor’s organization in the class are listed. If the instructor is a contract instructor, all students enrolled in the class are listed.
1. Review the listed badges and the students and click **Issue Badges**. A list of the students and the badges issued to them will appear at the bottom of the page under the heading “The following badges were successfully issued:”

> Note: Students are only allowed to earn a badge once. Therefore, if there are any errors in issuing the badge, you will receive a warning message stating: **Warning: Not all badges were successfully issued. See the Failed Badge list for details.** These failures will be listed at the bottom of the page under the heading “The following badge issuances failed:”. A description of the failure will be included.

## Course Assignments
As an administrator, you can also issue badges to students from their course assignments using the following steps:

1. Navigate to the course assignment and click **Issue a Badge** in the quick access bar.
1. In the **Choose Badge** dialog, select the badge to issue and click **(Select a Badge(**. Note: Only one badge can be selected/issued at a time for course assignments.

There is no indication on a course assignment that the badge has been issued. To verify this, you can either look at the Find Issued Badges page or at the Achievements/Badges page of the student.
